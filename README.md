=====================


   Program that randomly set pairings of gift givers/receivers.
   Each person has to be both a gift-giver and gift-receiver and there should
   be no reciprocal pairings. Also there are no repeated pairings with the 4
   previous seasons. Just press "enter" to generate a set of pairs and press
   "q" or "Q" to exit the program.
